## Project Introduction
Nowadays, some govermemts force to monitor all information including people's communication in the Internet. Some companies cooperate with their authority to implement censorship through machines to block or cancel some information. Hence, we desire to create a secure code software to exchange information under machines censorship.

We will introduce crypotography to encrypt and decrypt our communication and data to allow users to have a secure method to exchange information. The idea is from Mooncake history in the Ming dynasty in China.

## Technical Overview
1. We will use read from file to unlock first phase.
2. We will use a group of binary-to-text encoding method to change our orginal information.
3. After our encoding, we will modify encryption information to become more hard to use brute-force-attack.

## Possible Challenges
Try to implement a key file as unlock to decrypt code.
